# Helix + Zellij/Tmux + AI + REPL Workflow

This repository provides a complete workflow integration for modern development
using Helix editor, Zellij or Tmux terminal multiplexers, AI CLI apps, and REPL
environments. The workflow is built around a small set of scripts with minimal
dependencies:

## Overview

- **`haico`** - AI-powered code completion for Helix editor supporting OpenAI,
  Gemini, Codestral and Claude providers
- **`qantara`** - Smart REPL bridge router that detects Zellij or Tmux and forwards
  commands to `zqantara` or `tqantara` (use this in Helix configs)
- **`zqantara`** - Zellij REPL backend with bracketed paste support for all Zellij
  window types
- **`tqantara`** - Tmux REPL backend with bracketed paste support for windows,
  panes, and popups
- **`symbol-search`** - Workspace-wide symbol (word) completion using command line tools

This workflow enables seamless integration between:

- Code editing in Helix with AI-powered completions
- REPL interaction for Python, R, Shell, and other languages
- AI CLI applications like Aider and Claude Code
- Multiplexing: Manage multiple REPLs and processes efficiently using Zellij's
  tabs/panes/floating windows or Tmux windows/panes/popups.

All scripts are designed with minimal dependencies and focus on providing
efficient, keyboard-driven workflows.

> **💡 Tip**: Use `haico --help`, `qantara --help`, and `symbol-search --help` to view the complete
> documentation of all supported command-line arguments and options. Use
> `zqantara --help` or `tqantara --help` for backend-specific details.

## haico - Helix AI COmpletion

`haico` provides AI-powered code completion that integrates seamlessly with
Helix editor, offering intelligent code suggestions using various AI providers.

### Features

- Multi-provider support: Works with OpenAI, Gemini, Codestral, FIM, and Claude APIs
- Recommended model: `gemini-2.0-flash` or `codestral` for optimal performance and speed
- Minimal dependencies: Only requires `jq` and standard Unix tools
- Context-aware: Understands cursor position, file context, and programming language
- Two-step workflow: Designed to work around Helix's limitations with buffer content and cursor position handling

### Dependencies

- `jq` - JSON processor (only external dependency)
- Standard Unix tools (`curl`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`)

### Setup

Set the appropriate API key based on your chosen provider:

```bash
# For Gemini (recommended)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"  # optional, for custom endpoints

# For Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Helix Integration

Add these key bindings to your Helix configuration:

```toml
[keys.insert]
# long completion
A-y = [
    "save_selection",
    "select_all",
    ":pipe-to haico --prepare --file ~/.cache/haico/data.txt",
    "jump_backward",
    """:insert-output \
            haico \
            --cursor-line %{cursor_line} \
            --cursor-column %{cursor_column} \
            --language %{language} \
            --buffer-name %{buffer_name} \
            --max-tokens 128 \
            --file ~/.cache/haico/data.txt
    """,
    "align_view_center"
]

# short (single-line) completion
"A-'" = [
    "save_selection",
    "select_all",
    ":pipe-to haico --prepare --file ~/.cache/haico/data.txt",
    "jump_backward",
    """:insert-output \
            haico \
            --provider codestral \
            --cursor-line %{cursor_line} \
            --cursor-column %{cursor_column} \
            --language %{language} \
            --buffer-name %{buffer_name} \
            --file ~/.cache/haico/data.txt \
            --stop '["\\n"]'
    """,
    "align_view_center"
]
```

**Note**: Claude models do not support newline/whitespace as stop sequences, so
single-line completion is not available with Claude.

## qantara - Smart Multiplexer Router

`qantara` detects your current multiplexer context and forwards all arguments
to the correct backend:

- If `$ZELLIJ` is set, it runs `zqantara`
- If `$TMUX` is set, it runs `tqantara`

This means you can keep one set of Helix key bindings that work in both Zellij
and Tmux. Use `qantara` in your Helix config unless you want to target a
specific backend directly.

## zqantara - Zellij REPL Bridge

Named after the Arabic "qantara" meaning bridge, `zqantara` bridges the gap
between your Helix editor and REPL environments in Zellij, enabling seamless
code execution and AI CLI tool integration. It is the Zellij backend used by
`qantara`.

### Features

- Bracketed paste mode support\*\*: **Essential feature** for REPL integration utility
- Complete Zellij mode support: Works with all Zellij window types:
  - Tab mode: Routes content to named tabs, creating them if needed
  - Floating window mode: Routes content to floating windows by position
  - Pane mode: Routes content to panes in specified positions
- Zero dependencies: Uses only standard Unix tools (`grep`, `bash`)
- Handle REPL creation: This script can also handle creating new
  tabs/panes/windows with specified programs
- CLI integration: Can also used for for Non REPL CLI tools like yazi, lazygit,
  Aider and Claude Code

### Dependencies

- Zero external dependencies - uses only standard Unix tools

### Helix Integration (use `qantara`)

#### Opening REPL Programs and AI Tools

```toml
# Open in tabs
[keys.normal.space.o]
g = ":sh qantara --tab --name lazygit --program lazygit"
p = ":sh qantara --tab --name ipython --program 'uv run ipython'"
r = ":sh qantara --tab --name radian --program radian"
c = ":sh qantara --tab --name aichat --program 'aichat -s'"
C = ":sh qantara --tab --name claude --program claude"
a = ":sh qantara --tab --name aider --program aider"

# Open in floating windows
[keys.normal.space.o.f]
p = ":sh qantara --floating --program 'uv run ipython'"
t = ":sh qantara --floating --program $SHELL"
c = ":sh qantara --floating --program aichat"

# Open in panes (embedded windows)
[keys.normal.space.o.w]
p = ":sh qantara --pane --pos down --program ipython"
t = ":sh qantara --pane --pos right --program $SHELL"
c = ":sh qantara --pane --pos stacked --program aichat"
```

#### Sending Content to REPLs and AI Tools

```toml
[keys.normal.space.space]
# Send to named tabs
p = ":pipe-to qantara --tab --name ipython"
r = ":pipe-to qantara --final-return false --tab --name radian"
c = ":pipe-to qantara --tab --name aichat"
C = ":pipe-to qantara --final-return 0.1 --tab --name claude"
t = ":pipe-to qantara --tab --name shell"

# Send to floating windows by position
# 'current' means use current floating window without switching position
"1" = ":pipe-to qantara --floating --pos current"
"2" = ":pipe-to qantara --floating --pos up"
"3" = ":pipe-to qantara --floating --pos down"

# Send to panes by position
"l" = ":pipe-to qantara --pane --pos 'down right'"
"h" = ":pipe-to qantara --pane --pos 'down left'"

[keys.select.space.space]
# Send to named tabs
p = ":pipe-to qantara --tab --name ipython"
r = ":pipe-to qantara --final-return false --tab --name radian"
c = ":pipe-to qantara --tab --name aichat"
C = ":pipe-to qantara --final-return 0.1 --tab --name claude"
t = ":pipe-to qantara --tab --name shell"

# Send to floating windows by position
# 'current' means use current floating window without switching position
"1" = ":pipe-to qantara --floating --pos current"
"2" = ":pipe-to qantara --floating --pos up"
"3" = ":pipe-to qantara --floating --pos down"

# Send to panes by position
"l" = ":pipe-to qantara --pane --pos 'down right'"
"h" = ":pipe-to qantara --pane --pos 'down left'"
```

### Recommended Zellij Configuration

If you're using a terminal emulator that supports the Kitty keyboard protocol
(such as Kitty or Ghostty), I recommend add the following line to your
`config.kdl`:

```kdl
support_kitty_keyboard_protocol false
```

Without this configuration, certain Helix keybindings that require `Alt+Shift`
combinations will not work properly. This includes keys like `Alt+C` (typed as
`Alt+Shift+c`) and `Alt+*` (typed as `Alt+Shift+8`). For technical details
about this issue, see Zellij Issue #4148.

### Current Limitations

Due to Zellij's API limitations, the script cannot retrieve pane names or floating window names:

- Content can only be sent to floating windows by **position** (not by name)
- Content can only be sent to panes by **position** (not by name)
- Cannot accurately target a specific pane/floating window by its desired name

### Why we need Bracketed Paste Mode?

<details>

Bracketed-paste mode wraps pasted text in escape sequences, letting terminals
distinguish it from typed input. Most modern REP Ls and command-line
applications support this feature, which offers several advantages:

- Ensures multi-line code blocks are pasted as a single unit
- Prevent REPLs from misinterpreting pasted newlines or special characters.
- Maintains proper indentation and formatting

</details>

## tqantara - Tmux REPL Bridge

`tqantara` is the Tmux backend used by `qantara`. It supports the same CLI
options as `zqantara`, but routes content to Tmux windows, panes, and popups
(Tmux 3.2+ required for popups). If you want a single Helix config that works in
both multiplexers, use `qantara`.

### Features

- Bracketed paste mode support for reliable REPL interaction
- Window, pane, and popup targeting (with automatic creation when requested)
- Zero external dependencies beyond standard Unix tools

## symbol-search - Workspace Symbol (Word) Completion

`symbol-search` provides workspace-wide symbol (word) completion for Helix editor
through command line tools integration. While it can work with only standard
Unix tools, it's designed to leverage advanced command line utilities like
`universal-ctags`, `ripgrep`, and `fzf` for better user experience.

It supports multiple search backends: `universal-ctags` for tag-based symbol
indexing, `ripgrep` for fast text searching, and `grep` as a fallback.

The script gracefully falls back to standard Unix tools using the included
`picker` script when `fzf` are unavailable.

### Features

- **Adaptive toolchain**: Leverages ripgrep, fzf, and universal-ctags when
  available; falls back to grep and the dependency-free `picker` script
- **Workspace-wide completion**: Symbol search across the entire project, not
  limited to the current file
- **Zero external dependencies**: Complete functionality using only standard
  Unix tools when needed

### Comparison with simple-completion-language-server

| Feature          | symbol-search                                    | simple-completion-language-server                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dependencies** | Standard Unix tools or established CLI utilities | Requires Rust toolchain for compilation              |
| **Installation** | Ready-to-use shell script                        | Binary compilation required (Nix packages available) |
| **Scope**        | Workspace-wide symbol completion                 | Files opened in editor session                       |
| **Integration**  | External picker via `:pipe` command              | Native LSP auto-completion                           |
| **Features**     | Symbol completion only                           | Symbol + snippet completion, more LSP features       |
| **Portability**  | Works anywhere with basic Unix tools             | Requires pre-built binary or compilation             |

### Helix Integration

Configure symbol completion with these polished key bindings:

```toml
[keys.insert.C-x]
# Macro ensures proper word selection before symbol search
"C-x" = "@<esc>hmiw<C-x>a"

[keys.normal]
"C-x" = [
    ":pipe symbol-search --rg",
    # Use grep if ripgrep is unavailable
    # ":pipe symbol-search --grep",
]

# If `fzf` is unavailable and the fallback picker script is used, add `:redraw`
# to ensure the screen is properly refreshed after the command executes.
# "C-x" = [":pipe symbol-search --rg", ":redraw"]

[keys.select]
"C-x" = [
    ":pipe symbol-search --rg",
]

# If `fzf` is unavailable and the fallback picker script is used, add `:redraw`
# to ensure the screen is properly refreshed after the command executes.
# "C-x" = [":pipe symbol-search --rg", ":redraw"]
```

The insert mode configuration uses a macro (`@<esc>hmiw<C-x>a`) to ensure
complete word selection under the cursor before triggering symbol search. This
approach provides more reliable completion context than command sequences,
which cannot accurately select word boundaries (`miw` operation).

## Complete Workflow

This setup provides a comprehensive development environment:

1. Code in Helix with AI-powered completions via `haico`
2. Execute code in REPLs via `qantara` with proper bracketed paste
3. Access AI tools like Aider and Claude Code through organized multiplexer sessions
4. Manage multiple CLI Apps with Zellij tabs/panes/floating windows or Tmux windows/panes/popups
5. Maintain context across all tools with minimal context switching
